# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to *Programming Tactus*.

This book is the comprehensive reference for the Tactus programming language. Where *Learning Tactus* teaches you how to get started, *Programming Tactus* covers everything—every feature, every option, every pattern you'll need to build production systems.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for developers who:

- Have completed *Learning Tactus* or have equivalent experience
- Need detailed reference documentation for Tactus features
- Are building production agent systems
- Want to understand advanced patterns and best practices
